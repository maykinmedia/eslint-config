# ESLint config

Shared configuration for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for consistent rules across
Maykin projects.

This package exposes a set of standard/recommended rules for ESLint code checks. You can
still decide to override certain rules/configurations on a per-project basis - a nice
feature of ESLint's flat config format. See below for example configurations.

## Installation

**Requirements**

* ESLint v8+, v9 recommended as it defaults to flat config.

**Install from npm**

```bash
npm install \
    --save-dev \
    eslint \
    @eslint/js \
    @maykinmedia/eslint-config
```

All plugins are specified as peer dependencies.
